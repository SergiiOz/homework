                <p class="paragraph">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve
                    o'clock
                    a troop of ten or
                    twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
                    clear
                    the
                    way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a
                    tranquil
                    gait, uttering now and then deafening
                    bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing
                    can
                    moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraph">The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas
                    Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited
                    philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                    Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                    revolvers upon them.</p>
                
                <p class="paragraph">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a
                    procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg
                    foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive
                    into this herd of beasts!"</p>

            <!-- PHRASE -->
            <p class="phrase">The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise. </p>
